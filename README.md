#Reminder-Beautiful CLI

What it does is reminds you about your daily day to day tasks, offering the features
like add reminder ,delete the reminder and edit it.

It targets all those who want to maximise their productivity.

It saves file in same directory in which you run the app- so better create a seprate folder.

Though not being a proprietary software, it can be subjected to some unkown error (10 percent chances for error), so please comment if a bug or error is found ,since I am new to software development a pull request would be approved immediately 

There is one second lag in the opening of app because of sound if you want to remove it ,or threading can be used

To auto start the app follow the following instructions:

		Launch the run app by pressing window button and keyboard button 'r'- or launch run app the way you feel convenient.
		Type 'shell:startup' in the run and a result a directory would to be poped out.
		Put a shortcut of the app or exe itself in the opened directory.
